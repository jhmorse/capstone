The study focuses on Florida students graduating from high school in 2003. The study includes an examination of enrollment in 2-year or 4-year colleges after graduation and, as such, represents a similar analysis as proposed by my hypothesis. However, this study examines tests related to advanced and dual-credit courses such as Advanced Placement (AP) and Honors. Enrollment in ELA based advanced courses in high school demonstrated significant increases in college credits earned, grade point average, and the rate at which students earned a bachelor's degree.},

Such programs can be beneficial to students to bring them up to reading standards as long as the student is not "tracked" into a remedial program, i.e. restricted to remedial classes across other subjects and as they advance in school. The article is included as a counterpoint to students that demonstrate higher literary achievement. Additionally, enrollment in remedial courses can indicate lowered literacy expectations for college admissions and could alter the influence of literacy achievement in secondary schools.},

Students, upon entering the upper secondary level of education, similar to high school in the US, have the choice of pursuing general education or vocational education. This article analyzes what role, if any, reading and spelling have on that choice and subsequent career choices. Literacy in lower grade levels is demonstrated to affect school choices in upper grade levels which, ultimately, affect post-secondary pursuits (college vs. vocational career). The relationship directly impacts college enrollment through a mid-level choice when entering the equivalent of high school.},

Tracks primary predictors of success at multiple levels: elementary, middle school, high school, and post-graduation. Test scores, attendance, and GPA are included as primary indicators of success, while enrollment in advanced courses and social skills also contribute to success. Intended to support the design and implementation of programs by school policymakers toward improving student performance and outcomes. The authors point out the difficulty in relating early achievement in school to post-secondary success. However, this research does note a relationship between early literacy and stadardized test scores, more specifically scores on college entrance testing (ACT and SAT). Additionally, higher scores on AP and IB exams are correlated with higher rates of college enrollment.},

  comment   = {The authors analyze reading comprehension as a hybrid task that involves multiple activities including reading, comprehending, and writing. A common example is analyzing and summarizing an article after reading it. In the analysis, the authors compare students with and without reading difficulties to understand the comprehension process and the iterative cycles used to understand and write about a topic. Of most relevance in this study is the conclusion that reading comprehension strategies do not vary as children age. Students were studied at the primary and secondary level in Spain, where the primary level includes 5th and sixth grades, while the secondary level equates to US high school. This demonstrates a consistency in literacy activities across grades and may indicate achievement scores will stay consistent as a child ages.},

Crucially, the authors determined no difference in reading comprehension from the Canadian population as a whole, indicating that literacy skills were not a factor in university enrollment. Applied broadly, universities looking to attract students may disregard literacy skills, potentially impacting student readiness and success in college.},
